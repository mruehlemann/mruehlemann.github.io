I am a trained [molecular biologist](http://www.medlife.uni-kiel.de/en?set_language=en) who turned to data analysis and in the final phase of my PhD. My supervisor is 
[Prof. Dr. Andre Franke](http://www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/research/genetics-bioinformatics) at the [Institue of Clinical Molecular Biology](http://www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de).
We are located at the [Center of Molecular Biosciences](http://www.zmb.uni-kiel.de) in Kiel

### [](#RI)Reasearch Interest

My PhD project is part of the [Collaborative Research Center 1182 - Origin and Function of Metagenomes](http://www.metagenome-research.com).

I am generally focussing on the factors that shape the human intestinal microbiota, I am investigating effects of chronic disease, genetics, evolution and environmental factors.

To achieve this, I am analyzing data generated by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics, developing my own tools and pipelines.
